## Introduction
 
As you may already know, I've created this blog with the intention of writing about cloud computing and big data in an uncomplicated way, sharing stuff I've learned while working as a solutions architect.
 
But to do that it would be nice to start from the beginning: what is big data? How big does the data have to be? And what does big even mean in this context? How do we know that we are not dealing with traditional data anymore and that we started dealing with big dsta?
 
### The 3 V's

A widely used way of defining big data is by using the 3 V's:

- **Volume**: The size and amount of data.
- **Variety**: Many data formats and sources. It could include documents of different formats, server logs, transaction logs, web page usage logs, social network interactions, and other types of data that make sense for your application.
- **Velocity**: How fast the data is generated and how fast it has to be processed in order to generate the results we want.
 
### Ok, so what volume, variety and velocity? 

The 3 V's are widely used to define big data, but it doesn't provide any specific numbers so that you can say that from X GBs on or from the speed Y on, it is big data. 

So now you might be thinking: Ok Vanessa, but I want to know the numbers! When can I start using the term big data then? 

My answer is: well, it depends (pro tip: this is almost always the answer).
 
It depends on your computing power, the resources you have available to handle the data, and the expectations you have for the results you want to generate.
 
At a big data workshop a few years ago, I heard something that made a lot of sense to me:
 
***When traditional tools are no longer enough for you to generate results in the time and way you need, and you feel the need to start using new tools, you may be dealing with big data. This will depend on what computing resources you have available at the moment, what results you are looking for and how soon they need to be available.***
 
If you are wondering if I wrote all that to summarize the answer with "it depends", then you are correct. But now you know what elements to take into account when trying to understand whether or not you're dealing with big data.
