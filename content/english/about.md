![Vanessa](/about-me.jpg)

This blog was created by me, Vanessa Marques, with the intention of sharing stuff that I've learned and that I think it might be useful to others. My goal is to write content that is easy to understand and that can motivate you to start (or continue) your journey through cloud and big data. 

A little bit about myself:

* I'm a computer engineer passionated about technology, cloud computing and big data. 
* I'm an AWS Certified Solutions Architect on both Professional and Associate levels.
* I've been working daily in the clouds for over 5 years now and I **LOVE IT**! 
* I'm originally from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
* I'm currently based in Wellington, New Zealand.  

Reach out to me if you have anything to say! I'll be glad to hear from you.
